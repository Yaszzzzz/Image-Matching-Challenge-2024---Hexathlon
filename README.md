Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon
Overview
Welcome to my participation in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. This project focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images across six different domains, using computer vision techniques such as feature extraction and structure-from-motion (SfM).

Project Description
In this project, I participated in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. The goal was to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images using advanced computer vision techniques. Key aspects of the project include:

Data Handling: Utilizing provided datasets containing images and metadata crucial for training and evaluation.
Feature Extraction: Implementing scripts to extract keypoints and descriptors from images.
Image Matching: Developing algorithms to find correspondences between images based on extracted features.
3D Reconstruction: Using tools like PyColmap to reconstruct 3D scenes from matched image pairs.
Evaluation: Assessing the quality of reconstructions against ground truth using specified metrics.
Project Structure
The project is structured into several components:

Data: Contains datasets, annotations, and metadata used for training and evaluation.
Code: Includes scripts and notebooks for feature extraction, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.
Kaggle Kernel: Utilized Kaggle kernels for computation, due to constraints on local resources.

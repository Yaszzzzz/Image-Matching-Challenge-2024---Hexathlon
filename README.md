Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon
Overview
Welcome to the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon project repository. This repository contains the code and resources used to participate in the competition. The goal of this competition is to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images across six different domains, each presenting unique challenges in computer vision and structure from motion (SfM).

Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset provided for the competition, including images and metadata.
Code: This directory houses all the Python scripts and notebooks used for feature extraction, matching, and 3D reconstruction.
Models: Placeholder for any trained models or pre-trained weights used during the competition.
Documentation: Contains additional documents such as this README, licenses, and any other relevant information.
Setup
To run the code in this repository, follow these setup instructions:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Kornia
PyColmap
Other Python packages as listed in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-matching-2024.git
cd image-matching-2024
Install dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download any necessary pretrained models or datasets specified in the code or competition guidelines.

Usage
Running the Code
Data Preparation:

Ensure your dataset is organized as expected (e.g., /path/to/dataset/train, /path/to/dataset/test).
Feature Extraction:

Run feature extraction scripts to extract keypoints and descriptors from images.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python feature_extraction.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --output_dir /path/to/features
Image Matching:

Perform image matching to find correspondences between images.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python image_matching.py --feature_dir /path/to/features --output_dir /path/to/matches
3D Reconstruction:

Use tools like PyColmap for 3D reconstruction from matched image pairs.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python 3d_reconstruction.py --matches_dir /path/to/matches --output_dir /path/to/reconstruction
Evaluation and Submission:

Evaluate your reconstructions against ground truth (if available) using provided evaluation metrics.
Prepare submissions in the required format for the competition.
Additional Notes
Ensure sufficient GPU resources if using GPU-accelerated features.
Fine-tune parameters such as similarity thresholds and minimum matching pairs based on dataset characteristics and competition guidelines.
Document any modifications or improvements made to the baseline algorithms provided.

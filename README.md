# Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon

## Overview

Welcome to my participation in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. This project focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images across six different domains, using computer vision techniques such as feature extraction and structure-from-motion (SfM).

## Project Description

In this project, I participated in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. The goal was to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images using advanced computer vision techniques. Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Handling**: Utilizing provided datasets containing images and metadata crucial for training and evaluation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implementing scripts to extract keypoints and descriptors from images.
- **Image Matching**: Developing algorithms to find correspondences between images based on extracted features.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Using tools like PyColmap to reconstruct 3D scenes from matched image pairs.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of reconstructions against ground truth using specified metrics.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several components:

- **Data**: Contains datasets, annotations, and metadata used for training and evaluation.
- **Code**: Includes scripts and notebooks for feature extraction, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.
- **Kaggle Kernel**: Utilized Kaggle kernels for computation, due to constraints on local resources.

## Setup and Usage

### Setup Instructions

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash

# Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon

## Overview

Welcome to my participation in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. This project focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images across six different domains, using computer vision techniques such as feature extraction and structure-from-motion (SfM).

## Project Description

In this project, I participated in the Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon on Kaggle. The goal was to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images using advanced computer vision techniques. Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Handling**: Utilizing provided datasets containing images and metadata crucial for training and evaluation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implementing scripts to extract keypoints and descriptors from images.
- **Image Matching**: Developing algorithms to find correspondences between images based on extracted features.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Using tools like PyColmap to reconstruct 3D scenes from matched image pairs.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of reconstructions against ground truth using specified metrics.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several components:

- **Data**: Contains datasets, annotations, and metadata used for training and evaluation.
- **Code**: Includes scripts and notebooks for feature extraction, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.
- **Kaggle Kernel**: Utilized Kaggle kernels for computation, due to constraints on local resources.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure datasets are organized as expected.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Run feature extraction scripts to obtain keypoints and descriptors from images.

   ```bash
   python feature_extraction.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --output_dir /path/to/features
Image Matching: Execute algorithms to find correspondences between images.

bash
Copy code
python image_matching.py --feature_dir /path/to/features --output_dir /path/to/matches
3D Reconstruction: Use PyColmap or similar tools for reconstructing 3D scenes.

bash
Copy code
python 3d_reconstruction.py --matches_dir /path/to/matches --output_dir /path/to/reconstruction
Evaluation: Assess reconstruction quality against ground truth if available.

Future Improvements
Implement additional advanced algorithms for feature extraction and matching.
Explore ensemble methods for better reconstruction accuracy.
Optimize performance for larger datasets and more complex scenes.

This revised version focuses directly on the project's content, structure, usage instructions, and future improvements without including the local setup instructions. Adjust the paths and commands (`/path/to/dataset`, `/path/to/features`, etc.) based on your specific project setup and requirements before committing it to your GitHub repository.
